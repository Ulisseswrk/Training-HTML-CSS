# 🌐 Front-End Practice – FIAP Software Engineering

This repository contains a basic front-end project developed as part of the Software Engineering program at **FIAP** (Faculdade de Informática e Administração Paulista). The objective of this assignment is to practice and reinforce core concepts of HTML and CSS by building a simple, well-structured, and visually styled web page.

## 📌 Purpose

This exercise aims to:

- Strengthen understanding of semantic HTML elements.
- Practice creating visually appealing layouts using CSS.
- Encourage clean code structure and good file organization.
- Simulate real-world front-end development scenarios at a beginner level.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To build the structure and define the semantics of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: To style the content and enhance the user interface.

> *No JavaScript or frameworks were used, as the focus of this project is purely on HTML and CSS fundamentals.*

## 🗂️ Project Structure
simple_website/
 - index.html # Main HTML file containing the semantic structure of the page
 - style.css # External CSS file used for layout and styling
 - README.md # Project documentation

## 📄 File Overview

### `index.html`

This file contains the core structure of the webpage, using semantic tags such as:

- `<header>` – Website branding or navigation
- `<nav>` – Navigation links
- `<main>` – Main content area
- `<section>` – Content sections (e.g., about, services, etc.)
- `<footer>` – Footer with contact or copyright

It may also include placeholder images, basic text, buttons, and hyperlinks.

### `style.css`

The external CSS file handles all the visual styling of the webpage, including:

- Typography (fonts, sizes, colors)
- Layout (Flexbox or Grid)
- Spacing (margin, padding)
- Responsive behavior (media queries)
- Custom styles for buttons, images, and navigation elements
